Click to select a tile, ENTER to move to it. Attack by clicking on a Hamster when you're next to it. You can only attack after moving and Hamsters can't attack and move on the same turn. Speedy moves fast but hits weak. Heavy moves slow and hits hard. Boomer hits REALLY hard but knocks himself out. Dr. Hamster heals herself every turn. Meaty has a ton of health. Adn then there's the Boss Hamster, he has a lot of health, moves fast and regens very quickly when his health is low. Your only choice is to run from him. Knocking out any Hamster will heal you for 20 health. Head towards the staircase to move down to the next level.
